# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project aims to create a thermostat system that controls room temperature by adjusting it by 1 degree every 200 milliseconds. Users can change the desired temperature by pressing buttons, and an LED light acts as a heater, turning off if the room gets too warm and on if it gets too cold. The system can also mimic changes in room temperature by responding to a person's finger's warmth on a temperature sensor.
# What did you do particularly well?
In the project I successfully managing and setting up various thermostat system components, including buttons, LED, temperature sensor, and communication, while handling errors effectively for smooth operation.
# Where could you improve?
The project could be enhanced by adding more detailed code explanations and improving error messages for better troubleshooting.
# What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The individual plans to continue utilizing resources such as development boards, sensor datasheets, and online communities for future projects.
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The skills I have acquired in managing hardware components, handling interrupts, and debugging code will prove invaluable in future projects, particularly in embedded systems.
# How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The project was structured logically with clear function names and descriptive variable names to ensure easy maintenance and adaptation, allowing for easy modification of specific parts without affecting the entire system.
